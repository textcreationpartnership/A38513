            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Dear, and truly Beloved Friends, Brethren and Siſters, in Chriſt Jeſus our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE ſincerely and tenderly ſalute you all in his free and tender Love, wherewith he hath graciouſly viſited us, and largely ſhed it abroad in our Hearts and Souls, to our own unſpeakable Comfort and Conſolation, and towards his whole Heritage, and Royal Off-ſpring, bleſſed be his pure and powerful Name for Evermore. And our Souls do truly and fervently deſire and breath unto the God of all our Mercies, that you all may be preſerved and kept truly faithful and diligent in his Work and Service, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Heavenly Calling and Indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with his Light, Grace and Truth, unto the end of your Days; as being livingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged thereby, all your appointed time to ſerve him, and to wait till your Change come, that none may neglect that true Improvement of your Times and Talents that God has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded you here, for your Eternal Advantage hereafter, in that Inheritance and Life Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal that never fades away. And that the whole Flock and Heritage of Chriſt Jeſus which he has purchaſed and bought for himſelf, with a Price incorruptible, may always be ſo preſerved in his own pure Love and Life, as to grow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and proſper in the ſame; and thereby be kept in Love, Unity, and Peace with one another, as becomes his true and faithful Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, is that which our very Hearts and Souls deſire, being often truly comforted and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the living ſenſe and feeling of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and Aboundings thereof, among faithful Friends and Brethren.</p>
            <p>And Dear Brethren and Siſters, unto this our Tender Salutation, We are concerned in Brotherly Love, and true Tender-heartedneſs, to add and impart unto you ſome Account of the Deceaſe of our Dear and Elder Brother in Chriſt, namely, his, and his Churches true and faithful Servant and Miniſter, <hi>George Fox;</hi> Whom it hath pleaſed the Lord to take unto himſelf, as he hath divers others of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants and Miniſters of late Time, who have faithfully ſerved out their Generation, and finiſhed their Teſtimony and Courſe with Joy and Peace. Howbeit, O Dear Brethren and Friends! That ſo many Worthies in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſerviceable Inſtruments in the Lord's Hand, are of late taken away and removed from us, ſo ſoon one after another, appears a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that deeply and ſorrowfully affects us and many more, whoſe Hearts are upright and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der toward God, and one to another in the Truth. The Conſideration of the Depth, Weight, and Meaning thereof, is very weighty upon our Spirits, though their precious Life and Teſtimony lives with us, as being of that ſame Body, united to one Head even Chriſt Jeſus; in which we ſtill, and hope ever ſhall have ſecret Comfort and Union with them whom the Lord has removed, and taken to himſelf out of their Earthly Tabernacles and Houſes, into their Heavenly and Everlaſting Manſions.</p>
            <p>This our ſaid Dear Brother, <hi>George Fox,</hi> was enabled by the Lord's power, to Preach the Truth fully and effectually, in our Publick Meeting in <hi>White-Hart-Court,</hi> by <hi>Grace-Church</hi> Street, <hi>London,</hi> on the eleventh Day of this inſtant 11th Month, 1690. After which he ſaid, <hi>I am glad I was here; now I am clear, I am fully clear;</hi> Then he was the ſame Day
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35488:2"/>taken with ſome Illneſs, or Indiſpoſition of Body more than uſual, and continued weak in Body for two days after, at our Friend <hi>Henry Goldney</hi>'s Houſe in the ſame Court, cloſe by the Meeting-houſe, in much Contentment and Peace, and very ſenſible to the laſt; in which time he mentioned divers Friends, and ſent for ſome in particular, to whom he expreſt his Mind, for the ſpreading Friends Books and Truth in the World, and through the Nations thereof; as his Spirit in the Lord's Love and Power was univerſally ſet, and bent for Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and the making known the way thereof to the Nations and People afar off, ſignifying alſo to ſome Friends, <hi>That all is well, and the Seed of God Reigns over all, and over Death it ſelf. That though he was weak in Body, yet that the Power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over all diſorderly Spirits;</hi> which were his wonted ſenſible Expreſſions, being in the living Faith and Senſe thereof which he kept to the end. And the thirteenth Inſtant, between the ninth and tenth Hour in the Night, he quietly departed this Life in Peace, being two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord enabled him to Publiſh and Preach the Bleſſed Truth in the Meeting, as aforeſaid. So that he clearly and evidently ended his days in his faithful Teſtimony, in perfect Love and Unity with his Brethren, and Peace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to all Men; being about ſixty and ſix years of Age (as we underſtand) when he departed this Life.</p>
            <p>And on the ſixteenth of this Inſtant, being the day appointed for his Funeral, a very great Concourſe of Friends and People aſſembled at our Meeting-Houſe in <hi>White-Hart</hi> Court afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, about the Mid-day, in order to attend his Body to our Burying-place near <hi>Bunhill-Fields,</hi> to be Interred as Friends laſt Office of Love and Reſpect, due on that account. The Meeting was held about two Hours, with great and Heavenly Solemnity, manifeſtly attended with the Lord's Bleſſed Power and Preſence; and divers living Teſtimonies given from a lively Remembrance and Senſe of this his dear ancient Servant, his Bleſſed Miniſtry and Teſtimony of the breaking forth of this Goſpel day; his innocent Life, long and great Travels, and Labours of Love in the Everlaſting Goſpel, for the turning, and gathering many Thouſands from Darkneſs, to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, the Foundation of true Faith; alſo of his manifold Sufferings, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Oppoſitions which he met withall for his faithful Teſtimony, both from his open Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and falſe Brethren; and his Preſervations, Dominion, and Deliverances out of them all by the Power of God, to whom the Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was, and is aſcribed, in raiſing up and preſerving this his faithful Witneſs and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the end of his days, whoſe bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial will Everlaſtingly remain.</p>
            <p>He loved Truth and Righteouſneſs, and bore faithful Teſtimony againſt Deceit and Falſhood, and the Myſtery of Iniquity; and often of late time eſpecially, warned Friends againſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Earthly-mindedneſs, againſt getting into the Earth, and into a brittle Spirit; and the younger ſort, againſt Looſeneſs and Pride of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few days before he died, he had a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon his Mind, concerning ſome in whom the Lord's Power was working, to lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Miniſtry and Teſtimony to his Truth, who through their too much intangling themſelves in the things of this World, did make themſelves unready to anſwer the Call and Leadings of the Power of God, and hurt the Gift that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them; and did not take that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Service and Miniſtry as they ought, and mentioned the Apoſtle's Exhortation to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> to take heed to his Miniſtry, and to ſhew himſelf approved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And expreſt his Grief concerning ſuch as preferred their own buſineſs before the Lord's buſineſs, and ſought the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing worldly Concerns before the Concerns of Truth: And concluded with a tender and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Exhortation to all, to whom God had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted of his Heavenly Treaſure, that they would improve it faithfully, and be diligent in the Lord's Work, that the Earth might be ſown with the Seed of the Kingdom, and God's Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt might be minded by thoſe whom he had called and inabled to labour therein; and that ſuch would commit the care of their outward Concerns to the Lord, who would care for them, and give a Bleſſing to them. However, this is not mentioned to encourage any to run unſent, or without being called of God.</p>
            <p>Many are living Witneſſes that the Lord raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up by his Power, to proclaim his mighty day to the Nations, and made him an effectual Inſtrument in our day, to turn many from Darkneſs to Light, and from Satan's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God; and freely to ſuffer and bear all Reproaches, and the manifold Perſecutions, Buffetings, Haleings, Stonings, Impriſonments, and Cruelties that were in the Beginning, and for ſome time inflicted on him and others, for the Name of Chriſt Jeſus. He was in his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as a fixed Star in the Firmament of God's Power, where all that be truly wiſe, and that turn many to Righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever. He knew and Preached the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſt Revealed, the Life and Subſtance, and the power of Godlineſs, above all Shadows and Forms. The Lord endued him with a hidden Wiſdom and Life. He loved Peace, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured for univerſal Love, Unity, Peace, and good Order in the Churches of Chriſt. And where-ever he met with the contrary, it was his great Grief and Burthen. He was greatly for the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35488:2"/>Encouragement of faithful Labourers in the Lord's Work; and it was a great Offence and Grief to him, to have their Teſtimony weakned, or Labours ſlighted through Prejudice in any profeſſing Truth.</p>
            <p>And inaſmuch as the Lord ſuffered him not to be delivered up to the will of his Enemies and Perſecutors, who often heretofore breathed out Cruelty againſt him, and deſigned his Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in his good Pleaſure ſo fairly and quietly took him away in his own time, when his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was ſo bleſſedly finiſhed, and his Work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. This is all remarkable, and worthy of ſerious and due Obſervation, as being by a ſpecial and divine Providence and Wiſdom of God, to whom we aſcribe the Glory of all, and not unto Man or Creatures. Though we muſt needs allow and own, that good Report and due Eſteem, which faithful Elders, Miniſters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God and Chriſt have by Faith obtained, to the Praiſe of that bleſſed Power that upheld them in every Age in their day; Many whereof are even of late taken away from the Evil to come, and are at Reſt in the Lord out of the reach of all Envy and Perſecution, where the wicked cannot trouble them any more.</p>
            <p>And we muſt patiently bear our parting with them, and our loſs and ſorrow on that account, with reſpect to their unſpeakable Gain: Yet how can we avoid being deeply affected with ſadneſs of Spirit, and brokenneſs of Heart, under the ſenſe and conſideration of ſuch Loſs and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we have cauſe to believe are omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous of Calamities to the wicked World, tho' of good to the Righteous? Did the death of plain upright <hi>Jacob,</hi> namely <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (who was as a Prince of God,) ſo deeply affect both his own Children and Kinred,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.</note> as that they made a great and exceeding ſore Lamentation for him; and <hi>even the</hi> Egyptians <hi>alſo, that they bewailed him ſeventy days?</hi> And the Death of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo deeply affect the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.</note> as that they <hi>did weep and mourn for him in the Plain of</hi> Moab <hi>thirty Days?</hi> And the Death of <hi>Stephen</hi> that faithful Martyr of Jeſus, ſo deeply affect certain Men fearing God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>as that they made great Lamentation for him?</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when taking his leave of the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and telling them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 20.</note> 
               <hi>They ſhould ſee his face no more?</hi> If this did ſo deeply affect them that they <hi>wept all abundantly, ſorrowing moſt of all for theſe Words, That they ſhould ſee his face no more?</hi> (With many more of this kind;) How then can we otherwiſe chuſe but be deeply affected with ſorrow and ſadneſs of Heart (tho' not as thoſe which have no hope) when ſo many of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, dear and faithful Brethren, (with whom we have had much ſweet Society) are removed from us one after another? (We pray God raiſe up and increaſe more ſuch.) Yet muſt we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly ſubmit to the good Pleaſure and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord our God in all theſe things, who taketh away, and none can hinder him, nor may any ſay unto him, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> Yet we have cauſe to bleſs the Lord, that he hath of late raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is raiſing up more to publiſh his Name in the Earth. And we that yet remain, have but a ſhort time to ſtay after them that are gone, but we ſhall be gone to them alſo. The Lord God of Life keep us all faithful in his holy Truth, Love, Unity, and Life to the end. He hath a great Work ſtill to bring forth in the Earth, and great things to bring to paſs in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make way for Truth and Righteouſneſs, to take place therein; and that his Seed may come forth, and be gathered, and the Power and Kingdom of our God and of his Chriſt, made known and exalted in the Earth, unto the ends thereof.</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Dear Friends and Brethren, <hi>Be faithful till Death, that a Crown of Life you may obtain. All dwell in the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Peace in him; to whom we tenderly commit you to keep and ſtrengthen you; Bleſs and preſerve you to the end of your days.</hi> In whoſe dear and tender Love, we remain,</salute>
